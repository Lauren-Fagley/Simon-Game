# File Structure

simon-game/
├── assignment-02.html             // Main HTML structure
├── assignment-02.css      // Styling for layout and game interface
└── assignment-02.js       // JavaScript logic for game functionality

# How to Play

  Open assignment-02.html in a modern web browser.

  Click the "Start" button to begin the game.

  Watch the flashing light sequence.

  Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colored circles.

  Each correct round increases the sequence by one.

  If a wrong color is clicked, the game resets and the best score is updated if applicable.

# Styling

  Uses the "Orbitron" font from Google Fonts.

  Responsive layout using absolute positioning.

  Custom styles for each game element (buttons, circles, score displays).
