# Simon Game

A browser-based implementation of the classic Simon memory game. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience where players replicate a sequence of colored lights that grows progressively longer.
# Features

  Visual feedback with colored light animations

  Dynamic sequence generation

  Score and high score tracking

  Game reset on mistake

  No external libraries or frameworks required

# How to Play

  Open assignment-02.html in a modern web browser.

  Click the "Start" button to begin the game.

  Watch the flashing light sequence.

  Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colored circles.

  Each correct round increases the sequence by one.

  If a wrong color is clicked, the game resets and the best score is updated if applicable.

# Styling

  Uses the "Orbitron" font from Google Fonts.

  Responsive layout using absolute positioning.

  Custom styles for each game element (buttons, circles, score displays).
